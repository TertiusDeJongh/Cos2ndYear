# Cos2ndYear
Hi There! Welcome to my Git Hub. Here I have stored some of the projects that I have worked on in my career. 
Feel Free to download and run some of these projects and well use them if you like. I had a lot of fun coding them and sometimes a lot of trouble debugging but that is just the process right?
284A is assembler x84.

226A contains java files of practicals that ran threads.

Cos 212 file contains a file on ThreadedAVLTree that has a nice tester with displays in the terminal.

The .max filr is a 3D robot i made for an assignment. I will edit it and upload regurly
